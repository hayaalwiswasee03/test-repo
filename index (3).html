          <p class="no1">The Dance of Creation</p><br>
          <p class="name"> by Nour Walaa</p>
          <center><p class="articlewords"> You could sometimes listen to the sounds of nature combined and fell as it sings
A song no one could truly decipher but the creator himself, but if you listen, just listen and feel with the depths of your heart, you can feel your body swaying to the rythm , the rythm of all creation where each and every memeber plays his role perfectly to fit in the blanace of it all
Might seem a chaotic and disorganized pattern, but such dance is what is the proof that all life forms, all god’s masterpieces, are alive, with a mind and soul, with a feeling and sense , with the loyalty of belonging to one big system-the universe
The clouds move , air moves plants and water move and they all sway together in pure, sophisticated harmony
If you let go of the chains of our reality and let yourself move with their contsistent waves, feel their life , their breaths and their soul , if you let go of control over your hody and let your reality merge with theirs-
You will, even if for a split second, enter the dance.
And feel the caressing of them wonderful creatures as they welcome you and tell you its all gonna be alright, god is merciful, he’s with you and with us all, he sent us to cleanse your soul into a pure dazzling white , he sent us to make you feel – just feel , and to free you from the chains of numbness and disconnection-
You are one of us, part of our beauty, we share this world and we share one creator so powerful and more beautiful and marvelous than we could ever wish with our own comprehension and capacity-
Yet its our melodies that keeps us connected, we sway under the system he made for us , the system so organized and peaceful and so equalizing to each and every contributor, that we couldnt begin to hope for a better reality to exist , we couldn’t hope for a better sea to sway us into life , easily and joyfully.
Always remember, that even the air, even the smallest petals feel – they cry, but they don’t have the overwhelming burden of having a choice, they just belong and with certainty they live knowing their place in this big rhythm-
they already belong to this one gigantic piece of art , each knowing their place, their moves and their purpose
Yet we humans , we have to look for our place , for our purpose,
We have to fight for it and for a place in the world that is destined for us
We all have a role already decided by God, sometimes the role is altered by our choices, and in both cases, our choices are the original cause of what we were all along destined to receive
We have to fight for a role in the big dance, we have to fight for God , and for the acknowledgment of his existence and his beautiful mercies and… his beauty – which is already a blessing that can be sensed in the humble prettiness of nature
Nature took it all without the effort, but this life is all they will see of god’s potential ( I suppose)
Yet for the deeds we do, and for the effort we make, and for all the moves we make in spacetime reality to fight for existence. For all the trouble we face and stand strong and put our feet down against , for the obstacles we destroyed and passed by our determination and Love for God and life and all those around, we get perhaps what is the best of what God has , and there are no limits to his own power, and unlimited is what we get might he allow for it
I hope I could take my nature friends with me when I- hopefully- reach the limitless prettiness, I named them and i speak to them, god allowed me to and I will cherish every moment i spend with their unstained purity and their peaceful existence surrounded by the calming certainty of knowing where they belong . They aid me alot , they calm my fire more often than not . They are God’s kind soldiers , delivering his calming messages through their wonderful nature
They are thankful for their blessings , we should be thankful for how much better we are than- their already mighty position
All that and still no words could explain whats there in my head and heart and soul, I only told you a shred of it all , the rest- no words could bear to explain
Sorry for that long paragraph, but seems like inspiration comes to me in places and times most unexpected
For those curious, in my world, desert queens are palm trees and maidens are flowers.</p></center>
